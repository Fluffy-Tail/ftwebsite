3) Fees and Refunds
3.1) Payment 

3.1.1) You may access certain portions of the Service for free, but you may be required to pay a fee to access ‎certain features of the Service or to gain access to certain virtual items. The Company may license to you certain virtual goods to be used within the Service and which you may purchase with real cash or which you may earn or redeem via gameplay (“Virtual Items”). Virtual Items are licensed to you on a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable basis and limited only for non-commercial use.

3.1.2) A “purchase” is said to be complete at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Commodities and/or Virtual Currency are successfully credited to your account on our servers.

3.1.3) All purchases are processed and made through ‎the Apple iTunes Store or the Google Play store (each a “Third Party App Store”). You agree to provide accurate and complete payment ‎information to Apple or Google. You further agree to pay all fees and taxes incurred by your account. 

3.1.4) We reserve the right to change the pricing of the Service and any paid virtual items from time to time as we may ‎determine at our sole discretion with or without notice. Any change will not affect virtual items you have already purchased at ‎the time the change comes into effect.‎ In addition, we may modify our fees from time to time. In the event, you are accessing the Service under a Subscription and the Subscription fee for the Service you are using has been modified such that you are required to pay a ‎different fee than at the time you entered into these Terms, you will (a) be notified at your contact (e.g email address) for you on file at least thirty ‎‎(30) days before you are billed at the different rate, and (b) have ‎the opportunity to cancel your Subscription. If you do not cancel your Subscription before the ‎next billing renewal date, you will be deemed to have accepted the new fees.‎

3.1.5) The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, except where expressly authorized in the Services, if any.

3.1.6) Virtual Items do not have an equivalent value in real cash and do not act as a substitute for real-world money. Neither Xoin Inc. nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Virtual Items for anything of value. Xoin Inc. has no liability for hacking or loss of your Virtual Items.

3.1.7) If you do not connect your gameplay on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or a Xoin Inc. Account, we will not be able to restore any Virtual Currency or other data associated with your Gameplay to a different device. This includes if you lose that device or it is damaged. Accordingly, on a device that is not connected in this way:

  •  Any risk of loss of Virtual Currency that you purchase from us is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase.
  •  Any risk of loss of Virtual Currency that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Virtual Currency is successfully credited to your account on our servers; and
  •  Any risk of loss of other data associated with your Gameplay (including, without limitation, your progress through the Game, or the level or score you have reached in our Games) is transferred to you immediately at the time that Game play data is created by you.
3.2) Automatically Renewing Subscriptions

3.2.1) Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). If you purchase a membership to the Subscription, except where prohibited by law, it will automatically renew ‎at the beginning of each billing ‎period [(i.e., on a monthly basis)] on the same terms until you cancel using any of the cancellation methods ‎below. To check your next renewal date, log on to your Third Party App Store account and ‎look at the last payment date for your Subscription.

3.2.2) Trial Subscription may offer free of charge for a certain period of time from activation specified in the relevant offer in the Game. If you do not cancel the Subscription within such period, the Subscription Fee shall be taken from Your Account when the trial period expires. Please note that Your Subscription begins immediately after the activation of a trial Subscription, not after the seven-day trial period. You may cancel a subscription during its free trial period using the Subscription setting of Your Account. Xoin Games can not cancel your free-trial subscription if it has already been activated.

3.2.3) Subscription is automatically renewable unless you turn it off at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription. The subscription Fee shall be taken from Your Account within 24 hours preceding the expiry of the current Subscription. In case the Subscription Fee cannot be taken from Your Account due to the absence of monetary funds, the invalidity of your credit card, or for any other reasons, Your Subscription is automatically canceled.
3.3) Refund

3.3.1) We’ll refund most items that you buy with real money and use or receive in-game within 14 days of purchase, as long as they have not been claimed by the user, opened, or otherwise used the item. Any other way, the sale is final and we will not provide a refund unless otherwise required by applicable law. Your ‎purchase will be subject to the applicable payment policy of Apple or Google, or Valve’s Steam.‎

3.3.2) User agrees that for all sales that are final, Xoin Games will not refund any transaction or any cost taxes expenses related thereto once it has been made. Additionally, the User is not entitled to claim any right, compensation, damage, or refund for the Virtual Items or additional items.

3.3.4) If we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these terms you may lose any Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Commodities that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.
3.4) Taxes

Except as may be collected by us as required by applicable law and as indicated on an order confirmation page, you are solely ‎responsible for determining whether any taxes, including sales, value-added, or other taxes, levies, or duties, ‎apply to your transactions on the Service and at all times, you are solely responsible for the payment of any such, ‎applicable taxes.‎
